Professor Yael Hanein, an electrical engineer and nanotechnologist at Tel Aviv University, has worked with colleague Professor Dino Levy, a psychobiologist, to create a lie detector system that uses a test subject’s microexpressions to determine the truthfulness of a statement. Using electrodes attached to the subject’s face, the test looks for involuntary eyebrow and lip movements—two signs that Hanein and her colleague say occur with a majority of liars.
