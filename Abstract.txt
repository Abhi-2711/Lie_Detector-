ABSTRACT

It gives us great pleasure to introduce “LIE DETECTOR” as the mini project in our TE-ETRX.The goal of lie detection is the discovery of a truth that is known to one person and concealed from others. Psychophysiological lie detection, or polygraphy, is based on the theory that lying produces particular emotions, which produce corresponding measurable physiological responses. Psychophysiological lie detection dates back thousands of years.Modern polygraph measures blood pressure, breathing, and skin conductance. Alternative metrics such as voice stress analysis and functional magnetic resonance imaging are as yet unproven. The control question test uses relevant, control, and irrelevant questions. A larger response to the relevant questions is considered evidence of deception. The guilty knowledge test uses concealed information questions and irrelevant questions. Critics have questioned the theory and practice of polygraphy, primarily on the grounds that the emotion-based responses measured may not always correspond to lying. The polygraph is generally not admissible in court. Brain fingerprinting directly detects the concealed truth, such as the record of the crime stored in the brain, by measuring electrical brain responses. It has been ruled admissible in court.
